Hi, my name is Shirin. 
I'm currently doing my Bachelor's Degree in Data Science and Big Data Analytics from MIT-WPU, Pune. 
My second semester has a subject called Data Structures using C. 
This Repository mainly contains programs I have executed based on concepts I am learning through this subject. But, it also contains random programs that are one step ahead of what we're being taught that I wanted to test and try.
